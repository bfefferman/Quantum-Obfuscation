	have the following property: even if more than the threshold number

	relating to the past. This property is achieved while keeping the
	public key fixed and updating the secret keys at regular intervals.
	The schemes are reasonably efficient in that the amount of secure
	storage, the signature size and the key lengths do not vary proportionally
	to the number of time periods during the lifetime of the public key.
	Both proposed schemes are based on the Bellare-Miner forward-secure
	signature scheme. One scheme uses multiplicative secret sharing and
	tolerates mobile eavesdropping adversaries. The other scheme is based
	on polynomial secret sharing and tolerates mobile halting adversaries.
	We prove both schemes secure via reduction to the Bellare-Miner scheme,
	which is known to be secure in the random oracle model assuming that
	factoring is hard.},

  abstract = {Chameleon signatures were introduced by Krawczyk and Rabin, being
	non-interactive signature schemes that provide non-transferability.
	However, that first construction employs a chameleon hash that suffers
	from a key exposure problem: The non-transferability property requires
	willingness of the recipient in consequentially exposing a secret
	key, and therefore invalidating all signatures issued to the same
	recipient’s public key. To address this key-revocation issue, and
	its attending problems of key redistribution, storage of state information,
	and greater need for interaction, an identity-based scheme was proposed
	in [1], while a fully key-exposure free construction, based on the
	elliptic curves with pairings, appeared later in [7]. Herein we provide
	several constructions of exposure-free chameleon hash functions based
	on different cryptographic assumptions, such as the RSA and the discrete
	logarithm assumptions. One of the schemes is a novel construction
	that relies on a single trapdoor and therefore may potentially be
	realized over a large set of cryptographic groups (where the discrete
	logarithm is hard). Keywords: Digital signatures, undeniable signatures,
	collision-resistant hashing, trapdoor commitments, chameleon signatures,

	to try to introduce you to a certain, relatively new sub-area of
	cryptography that we have been calling practice-oriented provable-security.
	It is about applying the ideas of provably security to the derivation
	of practical, secure protocols. I believe it is a fruitful blend
	of theory and practice that is able to enrich both sides and has
	by now had some impact on real world security. A few years ago, provable
	security was largely known only to theoreticians. This has been changing.
	We are seeing a growing appreciation of provable security in practice,
	leading in some cases to the use of such schemes in preference to
	other ones. Indeed it seems standards bodies and implementors now
	view provable security as an attribute of a proposed scheme. This
	means that a wider audience needs an understanding of the basic ideas
	behind provable security. This article is directed at practioners
	and theoreticians alike. For the first I hope it will help to understand
	what provable security is and isn't, why it is useful, how to evaluate
	the provable security of a scheme, and where to look for such schemes.
	For the second group, it can serve to acquaint them with how the
	ideas with which they are familiar are being applied. I will begin
	by describing the basic idea behind provable security. (For many
	of you, this will be mostly recall, but some novel viewpoints or
	examples may enter.) Next, I will discuss the practice-oriented approach.
	I will discuss its main ideas, the problems it has addressed, and
	briefly survey known results. I hope to leave you feeling there is
	scope here both for interesting research and for application.},

	support for HMAC in these cases. This paper proves that HMAC is a
	PRF under the sole assumption that the compression function is a
	PRF. This recovers a proof based guarantee since no known attacks
	compromise the pseudorandomness of the compression function, and
	it also helps explain the resistance-to-attack that HMAC has shown
	even when implemented with hash functions whose (weak) collision
	resistance is compromised. We also show that an even weaker-than-PRF
	condition on the compression function, namely that it is a privacy-preserving
	MAC, suffices to establish HMAC is a secure MAC as long as the hash
	function meets the very weak requirement of being computationally
	almost universal, where again the value lies in the fact that known

  abstract = {The use of cryptographic hash functions like MD5 or SHA-1 for message
	authentication has become a standard approach in many applications,
	particularly Internet security protocols. Though very easy to implement,
	these mechanisms are usually based on ad hoc techniques that lack
	a sound security analysis. We present new, simple, and practical
	constructions of message authentication schemes based on a cryptographic
	hash function. Our schemes, NMAC and HMAC, are proven to be secure
	as long as the underlying hash function has some reasonable cryptographic
	strengths. Moreover we show, in a quantitative way, that the schemes
	retain almost all the security of the underlying hash function. The
	performance of our schemes is essentially that of the underlying
	hash function. Moreover they use the hash function (or its compression
	function) as a black box, so that widely available library code or
	hardware can be used to implement them in a simple way, and replaceability
	of the underlying hash function is easily supported.},

	The authors investigate new ways of designing pseudorandom function

	functions to practice. The basic building blocks in the design are
	certain limited versions of pseudorandom function families, called

	of the starting protocol against concurrent attacks. We can show
	that numerous protocols have the required properties and so obtain

	scheme based transform of any unforgeable signature scheme into a
	strongly unforgeable one. (This extends Boneh, Shen and Waters [8]
	whose transform only applies to a limited class of schemes.) The

	Our PRG is reminiscent of the classical constructions iterating a
	function on a random seed and extracting Goldreich-Levin hardcore
	bits at each iteration step. The latest PRG of this type that relies
	on reasonable assumptions (regularity and one-wayness) is due to
	Haitner et al. In addition to a regular one-way function, each iteration
	in their “randomized iterate” scheme uses a new pairwise-independent
	function, whose descriptions are part of the seed of the PRG. Our
	construction does not use pairwise-independent functions and is thus
	more efficient, requiring less computation and a significantly shorter
	seed. Our scheme’s security relies on the standard notions of collision-resistance
	and regularity of the underlying hash function, where the collision-resistance
	is required to be exponential . In particular, any polynomial-time
	adversary should have less than 2 ? n /2 probability of finding collisions,
	where n is the output size of the hash function. We later show how
	to relax the regularity assumption by introducing a new notion that
	we call worst-case regularity , which lower bounds the size of primages
	of different elements from the range (while the common regularity
	assumption requires all such sets to be of equal size). Unlike previous
	results, we provide a concrete security statement.},

	the lattice structure to achieve naturally nice distributions for

	where the client holds the encryption key for an encrypted quantum
	register held by the server, it is possible for the server to perform
	a universal set of quantum gates on the quantum data. All Clifford
	group gates are non-interactive, while the remaining non-Clifford
	group gate that we implement (the p/8 gate) requires the client to
	prepare and send a single random auxiliary qubit (chosen among four
	possibilities), and exchange classical communication. This construction
	improves on previous work, which requires either multiple auxiliary
	qubits or two-way quantum communication. Using a reduction to an
	entanglement-based protocol, we show privacy against any adversarial

	This is an important advantage if the signer produces many signatures

	signatures (and possibly re-negotiate the respective messages) with
	a new key. Apart from a formal model for fine-grained forward-secure

	under the strong RSA assumption only, i.e., we do not resort to the
	random oracle model to prove security. As a side-result, we provide

	Remarkably, these schemes meet the highest security notion in the

	CS scheme and its subsequent variants and extensions proposed so
	far feature a loose security reduction, which, in turn, implies larger

	the extra assumption made on the hash functions without relying on
	injective prime mappings. As a result, we obtain a practical signature

	function is usually designed from scratch or made out of a block-cipher.
	In this paper, we introduce a new security notion for hash-functions,
	stronger than collision-resistance. Under this notion, the arbitrary
	length hash function H must behave as a random oracle when the fixed-length
	building block is viewed as a random oracle or an ideal block-cipher.
	The key property is that if a particular construction meets this
	definition, then any cryptosystem proven secure assuming H is a random
	oracle remains secure if one plugs in this construction (still assuming
	that the underlying fixed-length primitive is ideal). In this paper,
	we show that the current design principle behind hash functions such
	as SHA-1 and MD5 — the (strengthened) Merkle-Damgård transformation
	— does not satisfy this security notion. We provide several constructions
	that provably satisfy this notion; those new constructions introduce

	(given a secret encryption key), as required for example in some
	medical applications where the distortion must be removable. Here
	we revisit the approach of Dittmann et al. from a cryptographic viewpoint,
	clarifying some important aspects of their security definitions.
	Namely, we first discuss that their notion of unforgeability may
	not suffice in all settings, and we therefore propose a strictly
	stronger notion. We then show that the basic scheme suggested by
	Dittmann et al. achieves our notion if instantiated with the right
	cryptographic primitives. Our proof also repairs a flaw in the original
	scheme, pointed out by Hopper, Molnar and Wagner (TCC 2007). We finally
	address the issue of secrecy of media authentication schemes, basically
	preventing unauthorized recovering of the original media object without
	the encryption key. We give a rigorous security statement (that is,
	the best security guarantee we can achieve) and prove again that
	the scheme by Dittmann et al. meets this security level if the right
	cryptographic building blocks are deployed. Together our notions
	of unforgeability and of secrecy therefore give very strong security

	mobile phones — operating in an environment where the private (signing)k

	are one way to mitigate the damage done when this occurs. In the
	key-insulated model [6], the secret key stored on an insecure device
	is refreshed at discrete time periods via interaction with a physically-secure
	device which stores a master key . All signing is still done by the
	insecure device, and the public key remains fixed throughout the

	an adversary who compromises the insecure device and obtains secret
	keys for up to t periods is unable to forge signatures for any of
	the remaining N-t periods. Furthermore, the physically-secure device
	(or an adversary who compromises only this device)is unable to forge
	signatures for any time period. We present here constructions of
	strong key-insulated signature schemes based on a variety of assumptions.
	First, we demonstrate a generic construction of a strong (N— 1,N)-key-insulated
	signature scheme using any standard signature scheme. We then give
	a construction of a strong (t,N)-signature scheme whose security
	may be based on the discrete logarithm assumption in the random oracle
	model. This construction offers faster signing and verification than
	the generic construction, at the expense of O(t)k ey update time
	and key length. Finally, we construct strong (N —1,N)-key-insulated
	schemes based on any trapdoor signature scheme (a notion we introduce
	here); our resulting construction in fact serves as an identity-based
	signature scheme as well. This leads to very efficient solutions

  abstract = {Cascade chaining is a very efficient and popular mode of operation
	for building various kinds of cryptographic hash functions. In particular,
	it is the basis of the most heavily utilized SHA function family.
	Recently, many researchers pointed out various practical and theoretical
	deficiencies of this mode, which resulted in a renewed interest in
	building specialized modes of operations and new hash functions with
	better security. Unfortunately, it appears unlikely that a new hash
	function (say, based on a new mode of operation) would be widely
	adopted before being standardized, which is not expected to happen
	in the foreseeable future. Instead, it seems likely that practitioners
	would continue to use the cascade chaining, and the SHA family in
	particular, and try to work around the deficiencies mentioned above.
	In this paper we provide a thorough treatment of how to soundly design
	a secure hash function H? from a given cascade-based hash function
	H for various cryptographic applications, such as collision-resistance,
	one-wayness, pseudorandomness, etc. We require each proposed construction
	of H? to satisfy the following axioms . 1  The construction consists
	of one or two black-box calls to H. 1  In particular, one is not
	allowed to know/use anything about the internals of H, such as modifying
	the initialization vector or affecting the value of the chaining
	variable. 1  The construction should support variable-length inputs.
	1  Compared to a single evaluation of H(M), the evaluation of H?(M)
	should make at most a fixed (small constant) number of extra calls
	to the underlying compression function of H. In other words, the
	efficiency of H? is negligibly close to that of H. We discuss several
	popular modes of operation satisfying the above axioms. For each
	such mode and for each given desired security requirement, we discuss
	the weakest requirement on the compression function of H which would
	make this mode secure. We also give the implications of these results
	for using existing hash functions SHA-x, where x???{1,224,256,384,512}.},

	approach yields two different but related solutions: One construction
	is somewhat theoretic, but conceptually simple and therefore gives
	an easier proof that one-way permutations suffice to construct pseudorandom
	function tribe ensembles. The other, slightly more complicated solution
	provides a practical construction; it starts with an arbitrary pseudorandom
	function ensemble and assimilates the one-way permutation to this
	ensemble. Therefore, the second solution inherits important characteristics
	of the underlying pseudorandom function ensemble: it is almost as
	efficient and if the starting pseudorandom function ensemble is invertible
	then so is the derived tribe ensemble. We also show that the latter
	solution yields so-called committing private-key encryption schemes.

	secure 3-round public-coin identification schemes into digital signature
	schemes. The idea of the transformation was to replace the random
	message of the verifier in the identification scheme, with the value
	of some deterministic hash function evaluated on various quantities
	in the protocol and on the message to be signed. The Fiat-Shamir
	methodology for producing digital signature schemes quickly gained
	popularity as it yields efficient and easy to implement digital signature
	schemes. The most important question however remained open: are the
	digital signatures produced by the Fiat-Shamir methodology secure?
	We answer this question negatively. We show that there exist secure
	3-round public-coin identification schemes for which the Fiat-Shamir
	transformation yields insecure digital signature schemes for any
	hash function used by the transformation. This is in contrast to
	the work of Pointcheval and Stern which proved that the Fiat-Shamir
	methodology always produces digital signatures secure against chosen
	message attack in the "Random Oracle Model" - when the hash function
	is modeled by a random oracle. Among other things, we make new usage
	of Barak's technique for taking advantage of nonblack-box access
	to a program, this time in the context of digital signatures.},

	is not nearly as efficient nor as security preserving as one may

	to the size of the input. In particular, given one-way functions
	on n bits one obtains by [HILL99] pseudorandom generators with seed
	length ( n 8 ). Alternative constructions that are far more efficient
	exist when assuming the one-way function is of a certain restricted
	structure (e.g. a permutations or a regular function). Recently,
	Holenstein [Hol06] addressed a different type of restriction. It
	is demonstrated in [Hol06] that the blowup in the construction may
	be reduced when considering one-way functions that have exponential
	hardness. This result generalizes the original construction of [HILL99]
	and obtains a generator from any exponentially hard one-way function
	with a blowup of ( n 5 ), and even ( n 4 log 2 n ) if the security
	of the resulting pseudorandom generator is allowed to have weaker
	(yet super-polynomial) security. In this work we show a construction
	of a pseudorandom generator from any exponentially hard one-way function
	with a blowup of only ( n 2 ) and respectively, only ( n log 2 n
	) if the security of the resulting pseudorandom generator is allowed
	to have only super-polynomial security. Our technique does not take
	the path of the original [HILL99] methodology, but rather follows
	by using the tools recently presented in [HHR05] (for the setting

  abstract = {We consider two of the most fundamental theorems in Cryptography.
	The first, due to Håstad et al. [HILL99], is that pseudorandom generators
	can be constructed from any one-way function. The second due to Yao
	[Yao82] states that the existence of weak one-way functions (i.e.
	functions on which every efficient algorithm fails to invert with
	some noticeable probability) implies the existence of full fledged
	one-way functions. These powerful plausibility results shape our
	understanding of hardness and randomness in Cryptography. Unfortunately,
	the reductions given in [HILL99, Yao82] are not as security preserving
	as one may desire. The main reason for the security deterioration
	is the input blow up in both of these constructions. For example,
	given one-way functions on n bits one obtains by [HILL99] pseudorandom
	generators with seed length ?(n 8). This paper revisits a technique
	that we call the Randomized Iterate, introduced by Goldreich, et.
	al.[GKL93]. This technique was used in  to give a construction of
	pseudorandom generators from regular one-way functions. We simplify
	and strengthen this technique in order to obtain a similar reduction
	where the seed length of the resulting generators is as short as
	rather than ?(n 3) in [GKL93]. Our technique has the potential of
	implying seed-length , and the only bottleneck for such a result
	is the parameters of current generators against space bounded computations.
	We give a reduction with similar parameters for security amplification
	of regular one-way functions. This improves upon the reduction of
	Goldreich et al. [GIL+90] in that the reduction does not need to
	know the regularity parameter of the functions (in terms of security,
	the two reductions are incomparable). Finally, we show that the randomized
	iterate may even be useful in the general context of [HILL99]. In
	Particular, we use the randomized iterate to replace the basic building
	block of the [HILL99] construction. Interestingly, this modification
	improves efficiency by an n 3 factor and reduces the seed length
	to (which also implies improvement in the security of the construction).},

	(UOWHFs) from any one-way function due to Rompel (STOC 1990). We
	give a simpler construction of UOWHFs, which also obtains better
	efficiency and security. The construction exploits a strong connection
	to the recently introduced notion of inaccessible entropy (Haitner
	et al. STOC 2009). With this perspective, we observe that a small
	tweak of any one-way function f is already a weak form of a UOWHF:
	Consider F(x,i) that outputs the i-bit long prefix of f(x). If F
	were a UOWHF then given a random x and i it would be hard to come
	up with x????x such that F(x,i)?=?F(x?,i). While this may not be
	the case, we show (rather easily) that it is hard to sample x? with
	almost full entropy among all the possible such values of x?. The
	rest of our construction simply amplifies and exploits this basic
	property. With this and other recent works, we have that the constructions
	of three fundamental cryptographic primitives (Pseudorandom Generators,
	Statistically Hiding Commitments and UOWHFs) out of one-way functions
	are to a large extent unified. In particular, all three constructions
	rely on and manipulate computational notions of entropy in similar
	ways. Pseudorandom Generators rely on the well-established notion
	of pseudoentropy, whereas Statistically Hiding Commitments and UOWHFs
	rely on the newer notion of inaccessible entropy.},

  abstract = {Signer-Base Intrusion-Resilient (SiBIR) signature schemes were defined
	in [IR02]. In this model, as in the case of forward security, time
	is divided into predefined time periods (e.g., days); each signature
	includes the number of the time period in which it was generated;
	while the public key remains the same, the secret keys evolve with
	time. In addition, in SiBIR model, the user has two modules, signer
	and home base: the former generates all signatures on its own, and
	the latter is needed only to help update the signer’s key from one
	time period to the next. The main strength of the intrusion-resilient
	schemes, is that they remain secure even after arbitrarily many compromises
	of both modules, as long as the compromises are not simultaneous.
	Moreover, even if the intruder does compromise both modules simultaneously,
	she will still be unable to generate any signatures for the previous
	time periods (i.e., the forward security is guaranteed even in the
	case of simultaneous exposures). This paper provides the first generic
	implementation, called gSiBIR, of the intrusion-resilient signature
	schemes: it can be based on any ordinary signature scheme used as
	a black-box. gSiBIR is also the first SiBIR scheme secure against
	fully-adaptive adversary and does not require random oracle. Our
	construction does require one-way (and cryptographic hash) functions.
	Another contribution of this paper is a new mechanism extending treebased
	constructions such as gSiBIR and that of [BM99] to avoid the limit
	on the total number of periods (required by [IR02] and many forwardsecure
	ones). This mechanism is based on explicit use of prefixless (or
	selfdelimiting) encodings. Applied to the generic forward-secure
	singature constructions of [BM99],[MMM02], it extends the first and
	yields modest but noticable improvements to the second. With this
	mechanism, gSiBIR becomes the first generic intrusion-resilient signature
	scheme with no limit on the number of periods.},

	We present a new forward-secure signature scheme, called KREUS, with

	enables more frequent Key Update and hence allows shorter time periods,
	enhancing security: fewer signatures might become invalid as a result

	is also very efficient, consisting of a single multiplication. We
	precisely analyze the total signer costs and show that they are lower

	of our scheme increases considerably as the number of time periods
	grows. Our scheme’s security relies on the Strong-RSA assumption

  abstract = {The design of cryptographic hash functions is a very complex and failure-prone
	process. For this reason, this paper puts forward a completely modular
	and fault-tolerant approach to the construction of a full-fledged
	hash function from an underlying simpler hash function H and a further
	primitive F (such as a block cipher), with the property that collision
	resistance of the construction only relies on H, whereas indifferentiability
	from a random oracle follows from F being ideal. In particular, the
	failure of one of the two components must not affect the security
	property implied by the other component. The Mix-Compress-Mix (MCM)
	approach by Ristenpart and Shrimpton (ASIACRYPT 2007) envelops the
	hash function H between two injective mixing steps, and can be interpreted
	as a first attempt at such a design. However, the proposed instantiation
	of the mixing steps, based on block ciphers, makes the resulting
	hash function impractical: First, it cannot be evaluated online,
	and second, it produces larger hash values than H, while only inheriting
	the collision-resistance guarantees for the shorter output. Additionally,
	it relies on a trapdoor one-way permutation, which seriously compromises
	the use of the resulting hash function for random oracle instantiation
	in certain scenarios. This paper presents the first efficient modular
	hash function with online evaluation and short output length. The
	core of our approach are novel block-cipher based designs for the
	mixing steps of the MCM approach which rely on significantly weaker
	assumptions: The first mixing step is realized without any computational
	assumptions (besides the underlying cipher being ideal), whereas
	the second mixing step only requires a one-way permutation without
	a trapdoor, which we prove to be the minimal assumption for the construction
	of injective random oracles.},

	have been used to allow transfer of digital signing power within

	signature paradigms (forward-secure, key-insulated, and intrusion-resilient
	signatures) have been suggested in the last few years for protecting
	the security of signature schemes, localizing the damage of secret
	key exposure. In this work we relate the various notions via direct
	and concrete security reductions that are tight. We start by developing
	the first formal model for fully hierarchical proxy signatures, which,
	as we point out, also addresses vulnerabilities of previous schemes
	when self-delegation is used. Next, we prove that proxy signatures
	are, in fact, equivalent to key-insulated signatures. We then use
	this fact and other results to establish a tight hierarchy among
	the key-evolving notions, showing that intrusion-resilient signatures
	and key-insulated signatures are equivalent, and imply forward-secure
	signatures. We also introduce other relations among extended notions.
	Besides the importance of understanding the relationships among the
	various notions that were originally designed with different goals
	or with different system configuration in mind, our findings imply
	new designs of schemes. For example, many proxy signatures have been
	presented without formal model and proofs, whereas using our results
	we can employ the work on key-insulated schemes to suggest new provably
	secure designs of proxy signatures schemes.},

	successful collision finding attacks against practical hash functions
	would indicate that constructing practical collision resistant hash

	to relax the requirement of collision resistance for hash functions
	that is used to hash messages in signature schemes. Currently, the
	most efficient strongly unforgeable signature scheme in the standard

	the Boneh-Shen-Waters (BSW) signature proposed in 2006. In their
	scheme, however, a collision resistant hash function is necessary
	to prove its security. In this paper, we construct a signature scheme
	which has the same properties as the BSW scheme but does not rely
	on collision resistant hash functions. Instead, we use a target collision
	resistant hash function, which is a strictly weaker primitive than
	a collision resistant hash function. Our scheme is, in terms of the
	signature size and the computational cost, as efficient as the BSW

	a generalization of the fundamental concept of the indistinguishability
	of two systems, called indifferentiability. This immediately leads
	to a generalization of the related notion of reducibility of one
	system to another. In contrast to the conventional notion of indistinguishability,
	indifferentiability is applicable in settings where a possible adversary
	is assumed to have access to additional information about the internal
	state of the involved systems, for instance the public parameter
	selecting a member from a family of hash functions. Second, we state
	an easily verifiable criterion for a system U not to be reducible
	(according to our generalized definition) to another system V and,
	as an application, prove that a random oracle is not reducible to
	a weaker primitive, called asynchronous beacon, and also that an
	asynchronous beacon is not reducible to a finite-length random string.
	Each of these irreducibility results alone implies the main theorem
	of Canetti, Goldreich, and Halevi stating that there exist cryptosystems
	that are secure in the random oracle model but for which replacing
	the random oracle by any implementation leads to an insecure cryptosystem.},

	can be viewed as being equal (in a well-defined sense) with probability
	1???d(X,Y), where d(X,Y) is their statistical distance, which in
	turn is equal to the best distinguishing advantage for X and Y. In
	other words, if the best distinguishing advantage for X and Y is
	?, then with probability 1???? they are completely indistinguishable.
	This statement, which can be seen as an information-theoretic version
	of a hardcore lemma, is for example very useful for proving indistinguishability
	amplification results. In this paper we prove the computational version
	of such a hardcore lemma, thereby extending the concept of hardcore
	sets from the context of computational hardness to the context of
	computational indistinguishability. This paradigm promises to have
	many applications in cryptography and complexity theory. It is proven
	both in a non-uniform and a uniform setting. For example, for a weak
	pseudorandom generator (PRG) for which the (computational) distinguishing
	advantage is known to be bounded by ? (e.g. ), one can define an
	event on the seed of the PRG which has probability at least 1????
	and such that, conditioned on the event, the output of the PRG is
	essentially indistinguishable from a string with almost maximal min-entropy,
	namely log(1/(1????)) less than its length. As an application, we
	show an optimally efficient construction for converting a weak PRG
	for any ?&lt;?1 into a strong PRG by proving that the intuitive construction
	of applying an extractor to an appropriate number of independent
	weak PRG outputs yields a strong PRG. This improves strongly over
	the best previous construction for security amplification of PRGs
	which does not work for and requires the seed of the constructed
	strong PRG to be very long.},

  title = {A Mixed Integer Approach for the Transient Case of Gas Network Optimization},
  school = {TU Darmstadt},
  year = {2007},
  month = {Februar},
  abstract = {Natural gas is the third most important energy source in the world.
	Presently, the consumption of natural gas is increasing the most
	in comparison to other non-renewable energy sources. Therefore, optimization
	of gas transport in networks poses a very important industrial problem.
	In this thesis we consider the problem of time-dependent optimization
	in gas networks, also called Transient Technical Optimization (TTO).
	A gas network consists of a set of pipes to transport the gas from
	the suppliers to the consumers. Due to friction with the pipe walls
	gas pressure gets lost. This pressure loss is compensated by so called
	compressors. The aim of TTO is to minimize the fuel consumption of
	the compressors, where the demands of consumers have to be satisfied.
	Transient optimization of gas transmission is one of the great research
	challenges in this area. We formulate a mixed integer approach for
	the problem of TTO which concentrates on time-dependent and discrete
	aspects. Thereby, the nonlinearities resulting from physical constraints
	are approximated using SOS (Special Ordered Set) conditions. A branch-and-cut
	algorithm is developed which guarantees global optimality in dependence
	on the approximation accuracy. Concerning the nonlinearities, we
	discuss the quality of approximation grids by calculating approximation
	errors. The SOS conditions are implicitly handled via a branching
	scheme, supported by adequate preprocessing techniques. A heuristic
	approach based on simulated annealing yields an upper bound in our
	branch-and-cut framework. To improve the lower bound, we incorporate
	two separation algorithms. The first one results from theoretical
	studies of the so called switching polytopes which are defined by
	runtime conditions and switching processes of compressors. Linking
	of different SOS conditions gives a second separation strategy. We
	present theoretical investigations of the SOS 2 and SOS 3 polytope.
	These polytopes arise from the modeling of SOS Type 2 and SOS Type
	3 conditions using additional binary variables. The results do not
	have practical relevance for our solution algorithm, but we characterize
	facet-defining inequalities providing complete linear descriptions
	of these polytopes. We evaluate the developed branch-and-cut algorithm
	using three test networks provided by our project partner E.ON Ruhrgas
	AG. Two are of artificial nature, as they were developed for test
	purposes. They contain all important elements of a gas network, but
	are rather small. The third network characterizes the major part
	of the Ruhrgas AG network in Western Germany. We test instances from
	three up to 24 coupled time steps.},

	was put forth by Halevi and Krawczyk in Crypto 2006, in conjunction
	with the randomized hashing mode that is used to realize such a hash
	function family. eTCR is a strengthened variant of the well-known
	TCR (or UOWHF) property for a hash function family (i.e. a dedicated-key
	hash function). The contributions of this paper are twofold. First,
	we compare the new eTCR property with the well-known collision resistance
	(CR) property, where both properties are considered for a dedicated-key
	hash function. We show there is a separation between the two notions,
	that is in general, eTCR property cannot be claimed to be weaker
	(or stronger) than CR property for any arbitrary dedicated-key hash
	function. Second, we consider the problem of eTCR property preserving
	domain extension. We study several domain extension methods for this
	purpose, including (Plain, Strengthened, and Prefix-free) Merkle-Damgård,
	Randomized Hashing (considered in dedicated-key hash setting), Shoup,
	Enveloped Shoup, XOR Linear Hash (XLH), and Linear Hash (LH) methods.
	Interestingly, we show that the only eTCR preserving method is a
	nested variant of LH which has a drawback of having high key expansion
	factor. Therefore, it is interesting to design a new and efficient
	eTCR preserving domain extension in the standard model.},

	functions, considering two essential theoretical aspects; namely,
	formal definitions for security notions, and the relationships among
	them. Our contribution is twofold. First, we provide a new set of
	enhanced security notions for dedicated-key hash functions. The provision
	of this set of enhanced properties has been motivated by the introduction
	of the enhanced target collision resistance (eTCR) property by Halevi
	and Krawczyk at Crypto 2006. We notice that the eTCR property does
	not belong to the set of the seven security notions previously investigated
	by Rogaway and Shrimpton at FSE 2004; namely: Coll, Sec, aSec, eSec,
	Pre, aPre and ePre. The fact that eTCR, as a new useful property,
	is the enhanced variant of the well-known TCR (a.k.a. eSec or UOWHF)
	property motivates one to investigate the possibility of providing
	enhanced variants for the other properties. We provide such an enhanced
	set of properties. Interestingly, there are six enhanced variants
	of security notions available, excluding ePre which can be demonstrated
	to be non-enhanceable. As the second and main part of our contribution,
	we provide a full picture of the relationships (i.e. implications
	and separations) among the (thirteen) security properties including
	the (six) enhanced properties and the previously considered seven
	properties. The implications and separations are supported by formal
	proofs (reductions) and/or counterexamples in the concrete-security

	these engines either require costly coprocessors, or the implementations
	become very large and very slow. Hence the need for better methods
	is highly visible. One alternative to RSA and ECDSA is the Merkle
	signature scheme which provides digital signatures using hash functions
	only, without relying on any number theoretic assumptions. In this
	paper, we present an implementation of the Merkle signature scheme
	on an 8-bit smart card microprocessor. Our results show that the
	Merkle signature scheme provides comparable timings compared to state
	of the art implementations of RSA and ECDSA, while maintaining a
	smaller code size.},

	this card enables the user to sign and encrypt the messages he sends
	and to decrypt and verify the messages he receives in a totally independent

	cards do not have to be updated when new users join the network,
	and the various centers do not have to coordinate their activities

	the cards are issued, and the network can continue to function in

	is fast enough for practical deployment on a low-end 8051-based embedded

	3.57 MHz can sign in just 170ms. A better 8051-compatible chip will
	take a lot less time. Security requirements today demand on-card
	key generation, and the big public keys of a multivariate PKC create
	a storage problem. TTS is unusual in that public keys can be synthesized
	on-card at a decent pace for block-by-block output, using some minimal
	information kept on-card. Since this does not take much more time
	than the I/O needed to transmit the public key to a reader, we can
	avoid holding the entire public key in the limited memory of a smart
	card. We show that this to be a gain for multivariate PKC’s with
	relatively few terms per central equation. The literature is not
	rich in this kind of detailed description of an implementation of
	a signature scheme — capable of fast on-card public key generation,
	on a low-cost smart card without a co-processor, and at NESSIE-approved
	security levels. We look into other theory issues like safeguarding
	against side-channel attacks, and using unusual techniques for linear
	algebra under serious space restrictions, which may help implementations
	of other multivariate PKC’s such as SFLASH. Keywords: Multivariate
